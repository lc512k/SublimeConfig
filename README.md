SublimeConfig
=============

Here you will find the contents of my SublimeText3 configuration files for:

- User Settings
- Pretty JSON Package
- HTML/CSS/JS Prettify Package
- SublimeLinter

These files are here because I like to keep them handy, especially when installing SublimeText from scratch, which I've done more times than I ever thought I would. So, they're mainly for my own convenience, but if you find anything in here useful, by all means take it.

Setup:

- Install Package Control: https://sublime.wbond.net/installation
- Once Package Control is installed, do ctrl-shift-p, Install Package to install:
  - HTML/CSS/JS Prettify
  - Sublime Linter
  - Pretty JSON
- Go to Preferences > Package Settings and edit the "Settings - User" file for each of the packages with your own configuration (use the files provided in this repository if we're working on a project together :))
