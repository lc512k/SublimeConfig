SublimeConfig
=============

Here you will find the contents of my SublimeText3 configuration files for:

- User Settings
- Pretty JSON Package
- HTML/CSS/JS Prettify Package

These files are here because I like to keep them handy, especially when installing SublimeText from scratch, which I've done more times than I ever thought I would. So, they're mainly for my own convenience, but if you find anything in here useful, by all means take it.
